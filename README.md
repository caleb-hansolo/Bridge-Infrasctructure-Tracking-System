### Overview
  Bridge Infrastructure Tracking System, or BITS, is an environmental simulation of the possible factors that can affect bridge health. The Tracking system uses the Raspberry Pi Pico W and Epaper 2.13 display to show a graph of weekly score based on a dataset and scoresheet linked below, as well as simulated environmental factors alongside the graph. This was made for the 2023 UNO IT Innovation Cup Hackathon.
